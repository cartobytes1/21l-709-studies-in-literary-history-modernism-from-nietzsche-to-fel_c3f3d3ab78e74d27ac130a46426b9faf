Students are required to turn in a term paper (15 pp.) at the end of the term and a preliminary draft of this paper (5-7 pp.) midway in the term. The paper should present a detailed comparison of two works studied in the course. In addition, each student is asked to present a talk in class (12 min.) on an assigned work on its assigned date. The talk should help stimulate discussion by means of arguments and questions. Papers and talks are conceived as exercises in literary interpretation through close analysis. They should be focused on specific passages from the texts under consideration and should balance detail with generalization.
